# Beginner_Piano_Tutorial_Video
Make a piano tutorial video beginner-friendly

### As someone w/o piano experience, I attempted to self-study piano by watching Youtube tutorials. There are some good Youtube tutorials, which are essentially "piano hero" video games. This is one example on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aasr_YK2UD4

### Some portions of the piano music are quite fast-paced. It'd make the tutorial videos a lot easier if piano key changes are to occur at fixed intervals so a beginner like myself can more easily follow along.
